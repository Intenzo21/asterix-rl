# Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent for the Atari Asterix Game.

We used RL with OpenAI Gym to teach an agent how to play the famous Atari Asterix game. This is done using different approaches for learning from the available input information such as screen frames or pixels, RAM memory, and a combination of the two. The various agent models were implemented as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that take advantage of the Q-learning algorithm. The evident conclusion to be drawn is that image agents are dominated by both RAM agents and mixed agents on all the recorded metrics.
